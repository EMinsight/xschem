if you are to use this as presentation, live, I recommend making the 'next' link bigger - like the whole bottom line or even the whole background should be link to the next page 

on slide 5 I find the headers strange 
especially 'item' 
GUI toolkit: TCL; are you sure it's not called TCL/Tk?

ok, well, this was done the lazy way by grabbing a table image , willl rewrite with HTML table.

(as far as I understood tcl doesn't do GUI) 
stefan
thanks will correct 
stefan
the table was a side-by side comparison of xschem vs Cadence Virtuoso, of course i removed the Cadence column :-) 
willl redo this slide 

slide9: I'd remove the download link from here, and would add a 'thank you and good bye' slide as slide 10 with the home page URL, svn URL and contact (at least email) 

 a list of all the different simulators you support, maybe with a short comment on how well that flow works, pros, cons 
- a slide about how you create a symbol (steps) just to show it's not different and not complicated 


another important point, especially after seeing so much fosdem: 
some listeners will find your presentation inspirative and will write a mail soon after the presentation 


but if you do a demo, I'd skip these, these are less interesting than the demo 
another important point, especially after seeing so much fosdem: 
some listeners will find your presentation inspirative and will write a mail soon after the presentation 
make sure you allocate some time and access your mail within some reasonable time frame (like 6 or 12 hours) after the presentation 
it's rather disappointing when the presenter answers only after  week 
"because I had to get home first", "but if I was there I decided to spend 2 days", etc 
being able to react in reasonable time shows the listeners are really important to you, not only the show
